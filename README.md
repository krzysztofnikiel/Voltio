## Recruit task for PHP Developer Task

I created this simple example on Symfony, but IMHO it's too much because I only used unitTest from the whole framework.

Unit Test is on TrafficSplitterTest Class, there are few examples.

I sent question about "You can assume that payment gateway instances has following API:
public function getTrafficLoad(): int;" but I didn't get any response so I didn't implement this to my code.
